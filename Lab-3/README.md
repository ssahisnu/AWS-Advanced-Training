<h3>Overview</h3>
Develop and deploy a cloud application using the Cloud Development Kit (CDK).
With the CDK, you will leverage Amazon Rekognition to identify human faces within images that you upload to an S3 bucket.
The components of this application will be defined in a series of Step Functions that is provisioned by the CDK.
All application development will be done within an AWS Cloud9 IDE.

<h5>Bootstrap the environment in the terminal</h5>
 Stacks that contain assets or large Lambda functions require special dedicated AWS CDK resources to be provisioned. AWS CDK only uses Amazon S3 buckets for this purpose. The 
<strong>cdk bootstrap</strong> command creates the necessary resources for you. You only need to bootstrap if you are deploying a stack that requires dedicated resources.

With CDK V2, By default, CDK now uses a pre-configured bootstrapping template to create the resources required to bootstrap successfully. 
Find the template <strong>customized-bootstrap-template.yaml</strong>

<h5>Subscribe to SNS</h5>
<code>snsTopicARN=$(aws sns list-topics --output text --query 'Topics[*].TopicArn | [0]')</code></br>
<code>aws sns subscribe --topic-arn $snsTopicARN --protocol email --notification-endpoint (YOUR-EMAIL)</code>

<h5>Deploy Application Stack</h5>
<code>cdk deploy</code>

<h5>Test Application</h5>
<code>inputBucketName=$(aws s3api list-buckets --output text --query 'Buckets[?contains(Name, `myappcdkstack-inputbucket`) == `true`] | [0].Name')</code>

<h4>Resources</h4>
<h4>AWS Cloud Development Kit</h4>
The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open source software development framework to model and provision your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages.
It provides you with high-level components that pre-configure cloud resources with proven defaults, so you can build cloud applications without needing to be an expert.
AWS CDK provisions your resources in a safe, repeatable manner through AWS CloudFormation.

<h4>AWS Step Functions</h4>
AWS Step Functions makes it easy to coordinate the components of distributed applications as a series of steps in a visual workflow.
You can quickly build and run state machines to run the steps of your application in a reliable and scalable fashion.

<h4>AWS Cloud9</h4>
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.
It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages,
including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.

<h4>AWS Rekognition</h4>
Amazon Rekognition makes it easy to add image and video analysis to your applications.
You just provide an image or video to the Rekognition API, and the service can identify the objects, people, text, scenes, and activities,
as well as detect any inappropriate content. Amazon Rekognition also provides highly accurate facial analysis and facial recognition
on images and video that you provide. You can detect, analyze, and compare faces for a wide variety of user verification,
people counting, and public safety use cases.
